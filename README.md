### Guidelines for contributions
Kindly upload your codes by putting into a seperate folder/repo.
The name of the folder/repo should be the topic name or your name (In case you want to contribute multiple repos.)

### Why it is amazing
You can contribute any piece of code in any language you're comfortable in to this repository, could be anything from a simple hello world to some programs from the programming assignments we get in college. You can go as wild as possible.
